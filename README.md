**Schedule**<br>
Alpha: Due Sept 28th<br>
Tyler: I will have a basic concept for level design, with functional doors, jump pads and a place for the player to move about illustrating the style that we will go for. This will be completed by Sept 24th.

**Module Three Project Log - Team Development: QA and Testing Plan**<br>
Prompt: As a game development team, devise a plan for quality assurance and testing your product. Begin by determining a preferred means of communication and a collaborative method to develop your document.<br>
**Demo:**
Testing before marketing will demo the project<br>
**Code Release:**
Checking the code release demo with the test plan<br>
**What items will be tested? Include a checklist of items to be tested (Pass/Fail).**<br>
- Player Character movement
- Enemy Character Movement
- Jump Pads
- Minimap (& UI elements)
- Keycards
- Virus (Enemy) reproductivity
- Doors<br>

**How will you update the test plan to reflect changes to the game and design document?**
Any and all additional features, mechanics, or assets will be recorded within the Test Plan sheet to consistently reflect the game as is.<br>
**How will bugs be reported and how will the bugs and their changes be tracked over time?**
Discord and Traceability Matrix

Schedule: Varies amongst members; congregate as necessary.<br>
Play Test: <br>
Demo: <br>
Code Release: 

**Features to be Tested Checklist (Pass/Fail)**<br>
Level design: Checking for holes in collision of the map, layout design and manueverability.<br>
Keycards: Ensure that they enable the ability to open locked doors.<br>
Jump pad: Applies the right amount of force, consistently no matter how the player is interacting with it.<br>
Sphincter muscle-shaped door: Ensure animation for opening and closing works based on distance (until introducing keycards).

How to report bugs and track changes: Tracability Matrix under "Test Plan" sheet.
