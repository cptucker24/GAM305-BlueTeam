Module Three Project Log - Team Development: QA and Testing Plan:
Prompt
As a game development team, devise a plan for quality assurance and testing your product. Begin by determining a preferred means of communication and a collaborative method to develop your document.

Develop a plan for quality assurance and testing your product. In your plan, be sure to include the following:

How will you test objects, levels, and games during the development cycle? Develop a schedule and include:
Play Test: Testing during the preproduction stage
Demo: Testing before marketing will demo the project
Code Release: Checking the code release demo with the test plan
What items will be tested? Include a checklist of items to be tested (pass/fail).
How will you update the test plan to reflect changes to the game and design document?
How will bugs be reported?
How will the bugs and their changes be tracked over time?


Schedule:
Play Test: 
Demo: 
Code Release: 

Checklist of items to be tested:(pass/fail)
Level design: Checking for holes in collision of the map, layout design and manueverability.
Keycards: Ensure that they enable the ability to open locked doors.
Jump pad: Applies the right amount of force, consistently no matter how the player is interacting with it.


How to report bugs and track changes: Tracability Matrix, it has a section just for that.
