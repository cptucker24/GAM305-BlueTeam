**Code Release: Checking the code release demo with the test plan**

**What items will be tested? Include a checklist of items to be tested (pass/fail).**

**How will you update the test plan to reflect changes to the game and design document?**

**How will bugs be reported?**
Discord and Traceability Matrix
